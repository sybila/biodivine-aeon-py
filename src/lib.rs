/// provides a `register` function that allows us to export it into Python here

///
/// Also, as a convention, wrapper structs for native types should use prefix "Py*", the same
/// way other structs are named within PyO3. In Python, the name can be different
/// (especially without "Py*") --- use the `name` attribute of `#[pyclass]` for that.
///
/// For each wrapper struct, please provide a `From`/`Into` conversion to the original type and
/// a somewhat reasonable `__str__` and `__repr__` implementations (`__str__` is normal
/// `to_string`, `__repr__` is `to_string` when printing in interpreter).
///
/// If reasonable, please also implement `__hash__` and `__richcmp__` to ensure correct type
/// comparison (alternatively, `__richcmp__` can be substituted for `__lt__`, `__eq__`, etc.).
