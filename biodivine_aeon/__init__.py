# Notes on Python version updates:
#  - TODO: If we ever move to 3.10, we can start using `TypeAlias`.
#  - TODO: If we ever move to 3.10, we can start using `|` instead of `Union` (and stop using `Optional`).
#  - TODO: If we ever move to 3.11, we can start using `Generic` and `TypedDict` together.
#  - TODO: If we ever move to 3.12, we can start using `type` instead of `TypeAlias`.
#  - TODO: If we ever move to 3.12, we can start using special syntax for generics.

# Counterintuitively, these two lines should actually reexport the native PyO3 module here. But it is a bit of a hack
# which does not work super reliably. Refer to the PyO3 guide for how this should be handled if it stops working.

LOG_NOTHING: Literal[0] = 0
"""
No progress messages are printed.
"""
LOG_ESSENTIAL: Literal[1] = 1
"""
Progress messages are printed only for operations of "non-trivial" complexity.

"""
All progress messages are printed.
"""

LOG_LEVEL: Literal[0, 1, 2] = biodivine_aeon.LOG_LEVEL
"""
A global variable which specifies what logging messages should be printed to the standard output. These are mainly 
used to communicate progress during long-running algorithms. I.e. they typically do not communicate any new
errors or warnings, just a rough estimate of resources being used. Note that these messages introduce some overhead
into every algorithm. While we try to reduce this overhead as much as possible, especially `LOG_VERBOSE` can have
measurable impact in shorter computations. For longer computations, the overhead should tend towards zero. 

 - `LOG_NOTHING`: No logging messages are printed. 
 - `LOG_ESSENTIAL`: Logging messages are printed when resource 
 consumption exceeds what is considered "trivial" in the context of a particular algorithm. 
 - `LOG_VERBOSE`: Prints all progress messages. This setting is useful for in-depth comparisons between algorithms, 
 but can be overwhelming under normal circumstances.
   
When `biodivine_aeon` is first loaded, the module determines if it is running in a normal Python script, or
in an interactive environment (interpreter shell, jupyter notebook, etc.). If an interactive environment is detected,
the `LOG_LEVEL` is automatically set to `LOG_ESSENTIAL`. **In other words, normal Python scripts do not print anything, 
while interactive environments should print some progress messages for non-trivial operations by default.** 

(Unfortunately, logging to other types of output is currently not supported. But if you need this feature, make
sure to get in touch.)

BddVariableType = Union[BddVariable, str]
"""
You can typically refer to a `Bdd` variable using its `BddVariable` ID object,
or you can use a "raw" `str` name. However, using names instead of IDs in frequently
running code incurs a performance penalty.
"""

VariableIdType = Union[VariableId, str]
"""
You can typically refer to a network variable using its `VariableId` typed index,
or you can use a "raw" `str` name. However, using names instead of IDs in frequently
running code incurs a performance penalty.
"""

ParameterIdType = Union[ParameterId, str]
"""
You can typically refer to a network parameter using its `ParameterId` typed index,
or you can use a "raw" `str` name. However, using names instead of IDs in frequently
running code incurs a performance penalty.

BoolType = Union[bool, int]
"""
Most methods can also accept `0`/`1` wherever `False`/`True` would be typically required.

"""

SignType = Union[bool, Literal["positive", "+", "negative", "-"]]
"""
Sign is used in the context of regulatory networks to indicate positive/negative interaction,
but can be also used for more general graph concepts, like positive/negative cycle.

"""
Lists the supported Boolean binary operators.
"""

BoolClauseType = Union[BddPartialValuation, BddValuation, Mapping[str, BoolType], Mapping[BddVariable, BoolType]]
"""
A Boolean clause represents a collection of literals. This can be either done through one of the valuation types, 
or through a regular dictionary. However, any representation other than `BddPartialValuation` incurs a performance
penalty due to conversion.
"""

BoolExpressionType = Union[BooleanExpression, str]
"""
A `BooleanExpression` can be typically also substituted with its "raw" string representation. However, this
requires the expression to be repeatedly parsed whenever used and is thus slower and more error prone.
