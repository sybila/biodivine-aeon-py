# default = ['static-z3']
# For releases, we want to include Z3 statically, so that users
# don't have to install it (or break compatibility with new versions).
# So for CI builds, this feature is enabled, but for local builds,
# you don't need it as long as you have Z3 installed (because your
# build may take >30min if you enable it).
