# This script computes the fixed points of a single,
# fully specified Boolean network.
#
# It either prints the number of solutions, or the
# fist N solutions, assuming N is given as a second argument.
#
# Note that if the network has constant nodes, we can automatically
# percolate them without changing the outcome. However, this is not
# enabled by default to ensure all nodes are present in the result.
# You can uncomment this modification below.
#
# Also note that computing only first X fixed points is not faster
# than computing the total cardinality of the set. I.e. the
# "time to first" and "time to all" is the same for this implementation.
#
# You can use `.aeon`, `.bnet`, or `.sbml` as input model formats.
#
# Print the fixed-point count:
# ```
# python3 fixed_points.py ./path/to/network.aeon
# ```
#
# Print first 1000 fixed-points:
# ```
# python3 fixed_points.py ./path/to/network.aeon 1000
# ```
