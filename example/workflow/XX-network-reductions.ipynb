For example, assume I have a variable `z` whose update function is `f(x, y)` (`f` being a parameter). Then, assuming that both `x` and `y` are essential activators, `f` can be only instantiated as `x & y` or `x | y`. However, assume that the update function of `x` is `!y`, and I try to eliminate `x`. Then the essentiality constraint can be retained, but `y` is no longer an activator, but rather a mixed/dual regulator. Hence `f(!y, y)` can be suddenly also instantiated as `y <=> !y`, `y ^ !y`, or many other functions.\n",
