    "## Drug Induced Effects on Interferon Signalling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we focus on a Boolean network which models a complex human cell signalling pathway, describing the activity of type-1 interferons and related molecules interacting with the SARS-COV-2 virion. The network is designed to explain the dynamics of *innate immune response* (**IIR**) -- an important biological phenotype corresponding to the activity of the immune system, and *inflammation* (**INFL**) -- a biological phenotype causing an overreaction that might cause severe health problems in affected tissues (e.g., cytokine storm \\[1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have adopted the BN model of interferon type-1 pathway produced by the COVID-19 Disease Map project \\[2]. The original BN model has been constructed from the openly accessible [SBGN curated pathway](https://fairdomhub.org/models/713) by employing the automated inference algorithm CaSQ \\[3] (see `interferon-pathway.sbml` available online under revision [51a2374f](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/covid/models/-/blob/master/Executable%20Modules/SBML_qual_build/sbml/Interferon1_stable.sbml)). CaSQ is producing ready-to-simulate (non-parametrised) BNs. Logical parameters here represent input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original BN model contains 68 variables, 190 regulations, and 53 logical parameters. The parameters can be classified into three groups: virus proteins, input signals, and drugs (`Azithromycin_drug`, `GRL0617_drug`, and `MNS_drug`). The phenotypes expressed by the actual cell are represented through special output variables: `ISG_expression_antiviral_response_phenotype` (or **IIR**), `Proinflammatory_cytokine_expression_Inflammation_phenotype` (or **INFL**), and `type_I_IFN_response_phenotype` (or **IFN**).\n"

    "Interestingly, from the logical parameters representing drugs, only the `Azithromycin_drug` was chosen by the automatic tree generation algorithm as relevant. Furthermore, if we perform stability analysis on the individual tree nodes, we can notice that the expression of phenotypes is not tied to the number (or types) of attractors, as we for example see in the T-cell survival case study. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the decision tree in `tree-full.pdf` shows the ratio of parametrisations exhibiting the **INFL** phenotype in each leaf node. We see that initially, most decisions do not impact the ratio of parametrisations expressing this phenotype (all nodes stay at `25%`). Only once we condition on `E`, we see some variability. However, even in this case, we do not see a clear \"appearance\" or \"disappearance\" of an attractor corresponding to an inflammation phenotype. \n",

    "Similarly, for **IIR** there is also no clear relationship between mutli-stability, and the presence of immune response.\n",

    "Finally, the **IFN** phenotype is not expressed in any attractor of the network for any parametrisation (see below). This is unexpected as it is one of the primary outputs of this network. *At this point, we attribute this to a model error and disregard this phenotype in further analysis.*"

    "To better understand the impact of individual parameters on the network phenotypes, we can manually compute the distribution of relevant parametrisations for each phenotype. In the following, we measure how much a network parameter impacts the expression of a particular phenotype. The number describes a change in the number of parametrisations which express the phenotype with the parameter absent or present. That is, a change of `+75%` for parameter `X` means that fixing `X = true` increases the ratio of parameters expressing a particular phenotype by `75%` compared to cases where `X = false` (e.g. `10%` when `X = false` and `85%` when `X = true`).\n",

    "In this table, we can see that only 32 out of the 53 network parameters actually influence phenotype expression (the ones with no impact are skipped). Furthermore, by the change in expression ratios, we can see which parameter has the highest impact on the network's phenotypes. For example, notice that `Azithromycin_drug` has a high impact on the **IIR** phenotype, while `E` and `MNS_drug` have high impact on **INFL**. Interestingly, `GRL0617_drug` does not appear to influence phenotype expression in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, we perform three more experiments, each following different conditions. In the first experiment, we test whether the parameter `Viral_replication_phenotype` has any influence on the impact of other parameters. Parameter `Viral_replication_phenotype` is a major factor in introducing multi-stability (as shown by the decision tree above). We thus want to confirm our hypothesis that the multi-stability caused by this parameter has indeed no effect on network phenotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we also test cases where `Azithromycin_drug` is fixed to `true`, and where both `MNS_drug` and `Azithromycin_drug` are fixed to `true`. This should give us a better insight into the influence of these drugs."

    "In the results, we see that `Viral_replication_phenotype` has indeed no effect on the impact of network parameters on its phenotypes (i.e. the numbers are exactly the same). Meanwhile, we see that after applying `Azithromycin_drug`, **IIR** is always active (and thus parameters do not have impact on it any more). Meanwhile, by applying both drugs, the effect of `E` is eliminated as a factor in inflammation. Also note that the impact of other parameters *grows* once we fix either of these two drugs, as opposed to the case of `Viral_replication_phenotype`, where it stayed the same."

    "Overall, the previous experiments give us a better overview of which parameters are important for phenotype expression and what is the intensity of their influence. We can now use this information to construct decision trees that actually describe when a certain phenotype is expressed. These trees are constructed in AEON by hand, such that we confirm using stability analysis that each unexpanded node only admits a particular phenotype. The tree screenshots are located in `tree-immune-response.png` and `tree-inflammation.png`, with `tree-immune-response.pdf` and `tree-inflammation.pdf` showing a compacted, more readable (but logically equivalent) version of these trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in both cases, the trees contain exactly the parameters identified in our previous experiments as the ones having impact on the corresponding phenotype. These parameters also appear in an order which follows their observed impact. Also note that while the inflammation tree appears to be much more complex than the immune response tree, the inflammation tree actually contains two equivalent branches, and depends on more parameter values (22 vs. 13)."

    "During our analysis of the type-1 interferon pathway, we have discovered several unexpected properties which suggest that the model is incomplete or biologically unsound. In particular, we have shown that the model as is cannot express any activity of interferons (**INF** phenotype) -- one of its main functionalities. Additionally, we showed that replication of the virus inside the cell (i.e. `Viral_replication_phenotype`) does not in any way influence the expression of the two remaining phenotypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also constructed a bifurcation decision tree characterising the presence of different multi-stable behaviour classes. However, in this tree, we do not observe any meaningful correlation between the number of attractors and the expressed network phenotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we were able to identify `13` and `22` logical parameters which actually influence the immune response (**IIR**) and inflammation (**INFL**) phenotypes respectively. Three of these (`TREML4`, `Nsp3`, and `Azithromycin_drug`) influence both phenotypes. Based on these parameters, we were able to construct decision trees which fully characterise the expression of phenotypes by this network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tree describing the **IIR** phenotype, we can observe that `Azithromycin_drug` always activates immune response. Meanwhile, in its absence, `Nsp3` (a prominent component of most coronaviruses) enables conditions in which immune response is inactive. Subsequently, other virus proteins (`Nsp*` and `Orf*`) further inhibit the immune response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the inflammation phenotype, we see `MNS_drug` playing a crucial role by counteracting the influence of the envelope protein `E` as a cause of inflammation. Interestingly, in this case, `Nsp3` actually acts as an inhibitor, with `Viral_dsRNA_rna_endosome` playing a crucial role in the activation of inflammation in the absence of `Nsp3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can conclude that in this network, `GRL0617_drug` does not have any meaningful impact on either the emergence of multi-stability, or the expression of network phenotypes."
